## About

This repository provides materials for the "Basketball Analytics with Python" workshop at the 
[2022 Basketball Analytics Summit](https://www.basketballanalyticssummit.com/).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires a working Python installation and was developed using Python 3.9. A Python installation for your
environment can be downloaded from [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page. The 
[Python Beginner's Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) provides more detailed instructions. 
Alternatively, the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) package, dependency, and environment manager is a popular choice to ease the installation
and management process.

### Installation

To get started with this workshop, clone the project locally.

    > git clone https://github.com/nrfrank/basketball-analytics-python-workshop.git
